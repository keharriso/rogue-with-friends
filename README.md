# Rogue with Friends

### About

**Rogue with Friends** is a 2D, real-time, multiplayer roguelike that is in
very early, pre-alpha development (read: nonexistent).

The game world is a series of procedurally generated floors, rendered as a 2D scrolling field of square tiles with sprite-based objects on them. The objects consist of entities (including both players controlled by humans and enemies controlled by AI) and structures (such as health and damage powerups)

The goal of the game is to cooperatively reach the bottom floor of the dungeon to acquire the Amulet of Yendor. Along the way, players encounter ferocious monsters and helpful items. They will level up and increase their skills. Players play alone or together in the same dungeon in groups of 2-4. This is innovative in that real-time, multiplayer roguelikes are either rare or non-existent.

The game is inspired by modern roguelikes such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, as well as real-time, multiplayer hack-and-slash RPGs like Diablo II.
